## Setup AWS RDS MySQL
Support for using a SQL database instead of etcd for the backing store of Diego is still in the experimental phase. The instructions below describe how to set up a MariaDB RDS instance that is known to work with Diego.

1. From the AWS console homepage, click on `RDS` in the `Database` section.
1. Click on `Launch DB Instance` under Instances.
1. Click on the `MariaDB` Tab and click the `Select` button.
1. Select Production or Dev/Test version of MariaDB depending on your use case and click the `Next Step` button.
1. Select the DB Instance Class required. For performance testing the Diego team uses db.m4.4xlarge.
1. Optionally tune the other parameters based on your deployment requirements.
1. Provide a unique DB Instance Identifier. This identifier can be arbitrary, as is not used directly in the Diego configuration below.
1. Choose and confirm a master username and password, and record them for later use in the Diego-SQL stub.
1. Click `Next Step`.
1. Select the VPC created during the bosh-init steps above.
1. Select `No` for the `Publicly Accessible` option.
1. Select the `VPC Security Group` matching `*-InternalSecurityGroup-*`.
1. Choose a Database Name (for example, `diego`).
1. Click `Launch DB Instance`.
1. Wait for the Instance to be `available`.

### Configuring SSL

In order to configure SSL for RDS you need to download the ca cert bundle from AWS. This can be done by:

```bash
curl -o $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/certs/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem http://s3.amazonaws.com/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
```

The contents of this file will be supplied in the `sql_overrides.bbs.ca_cert` field in the Diego-SQL stub below.

## Deploy Standalone CF-MySQL

**Note: MySQL can also be deployed with a single node for a minimal, standalone deployment. Follow the [instructions below](#scaling-down-the-cf-mysql-cluster) to provision a single-node MySQL cluster. **

We recommend deploying with an HA, standalone mysql that is resolvable via consul dns for stability and availability. To do this, copy the correct example stubs from cf-mysql-release and fill in their REPLACE_WITH values as appropriate for passwords and so on.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release.git
export CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR=$PWD/cf-mysql-release

mkdir -p $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql
cp $CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR/manifest-generation/examples/aws/iaas-settings.yml \
   $CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR/manifest-generation/examples/standalone/property-overrides.yml \
   $CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR/manifest-generation/examples/standalone/instance-count-overrides.yml \
   $CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR/manifest-generation/examples/job-overrides-consul.yml \
$DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql/
```

You will need to make additional changes to the `instance-count-overrides.yml`, `property-overrides.yml`, and `iaas-settings.yml` stub file.


### Set the CF-MySQL Property Overrides
1. Rename the deployment so you could use another mysql-release as a user service if you wanted to:
```yaml
property_overrides:
    deployment_name: diego-mysql
```

2. Anything related to the ELB and healthcheck endpoints can be removed, as we'll be doing service discovery via consul.
```yaml
property_overrides:
    host: YOUR_LOAD_BALANCER_ADDRESS # Delete this property
```

3. The CF-MySQL deployment must also be seeded with a Diego database, username, and password. Do this by providing the following property in your `stubs/cf-mysql/property_overrides.yml`:
```yaml
property_overrides:
  mysql:
    seeded_databases:
    - name: diego
      username: diego
      password: REPLACE_ME_WITH_DB_PASSWORD
```

### Set the CF-MySQL IaaS Settings

When filling out the [`iaas_settings.yml`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release/blob/develop/manifest-generation/examples/aws/iaas-settings.yml), you only need to create one subnet per availability zone and fill in the corresponding properties for the `mysql1`, `mysql2`, and `mysql3` network and AZ.  You can create an AWS subnet for the CF-MySQL deployment by:

1. From the AWS console homepage, click on `VPC` in the `Networking` section.
1. Click on the `Subnets` link.
1. Click on the `Create Subnet` button.
1. Fill in the name tag property for the subnet as is desired (for example, MySQLZ1).
1. Select the VPC associated with your deployment.
1. Select the AZ you used to AZ in the `stubs/infrastructure/availability_zones.yml` file.
    2. If you're configuring HA, the 1st subnet should match the 1st AZ, the 2nd subnet should match the 2nd AZ, etc.
1. Fill in `10.10.32.0/24` as the CIDR range.
    2. If you're configuring HA, try `10.10.33.0/24` and `10.10.34.0/24` for the 2nd and 3rd subnets
1. Click on the `Yes, Create` button.

If deploying in HA configuration, this should be repeated 3 times, once for each AZ.

Delete the following property, as we won't be using an ELB:
```yaml
properties:
  template_only:
     aws:
        mysql_elb_names: [REPLACE_WITH_ELB_NAME_NOT_DNS_HOSTNAME] # delete this as we don't need an elb
```

### Genera

### Deploy the cf-mysql cluster

```yaml
$CF_MYSQL_RELEASE_DIR/scripts/generate-deployment-manifest \
    -c $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/cf.yml \
    -p $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql/property-overrides.yml \
    -i $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql/iaas-settings.yml \
    -j $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql/job-overrides-consul.yml \
    -n $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/cf-mysql/instance-count-overrides.yml \
> $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/cf-mysql.yml

bosh -d $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/cf-mysql.yml deploy
```

### Scaling down the CF-MySQL cluster (optional, not suitable for production environments)

To minimize the deployment to only a single MySQL node use the following settings in `instance-count-overrides.yml`:

```yaml
instance_count_overrides:
  - name: cf-mysql-broker_z1
    instances: 0
  - name: cf-mysql-broker_z2
    instances: 0
  - name: mysql_z2
    instances: 0
  - name: arbitrator_z3
    instances: 0
  - name: proxy_z1
    instances: 0
  - name: proxy_z2
    instances: 0
```


## Deploy Diego

### Fill in Diego-SQL stub

To configure Diego to communicate with the SQL instance, first create a Diego-SQL stub file at `$DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/diego-sql.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml
sql_overrides:
  bbs:
    db_connection_string: 'diego:REPLACE_ME_WITH_DB_PASSWORD@tcp(<sql-instance-endpoint>)/diego'
    max_open_connections: 500
    require_ssl: true
    ca_cert: |
      REPLACE_WITH_CONTENTS_OF_(DEPLOYMENT_DIR/certs/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem)
```

Fill in the bracketed parameters in the `db_connection_string` with the following values:

- `REPLACE_ME_WITH_DB_PASSWORD`: The password chosen when you created the SQL instance.
- `<sql-instance-endpoint>`:
	- For AWS RDS: The endpoint displayed at the top of the DB instance details page in AWS, including the port.
	- For Standalone CF-MySQL:
     - If configuring an HA MySQL with Consul use the consul service address (e.g. mysql.service.cf.internal:3306).
     - If configuring a single node MySQL the internal IP address and port of the single MySQL node. (e.g. 10.10.5.222:3306).
     - *In both cases the port will be 3306 by default.*

**Note:** The `sql_overrides.bbs.ca_cert` and `sql_overrides.bbs.require_ssl` properties should be provided only when deploying with an SSL-supported MySQL cluster. Set the `require_ssl` property to `true` to ensure that the BBS uses SSL to connect to the store, and set the `ca_cert` property to the contents of a certificate bundle containing the correct CA certificates to verify the certificate that the SQL server presents.

### Generate the Diego manifest

Generate the Diego manifest with an additional `-s` flag that specifies the location of the Diego-SQL stub, as shown below. Remember that the `-n` instance-count-overrides flag and the `-v` release-versions flags are optional.

```bash
cd $DIEGO_RELEASE_DIR
./scripts/generate-deployment-manifest \
  -c $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/cf.yml \
  -i $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/iaas-settings.yml \
  -p $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/property-overrides.yml \
  -s $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/diego-sql.yml \
  -n $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/instance-count-overrides.yml \
  -v $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/release-versions.yml \
  > $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/diego.yml
```

### Disable and remove ETCD from your Diego deployment

Once you've successfully deployed a SQL-backed Diego, you may want to remove the now-idle etcd jobs from your database cluster to save on infrastructure costs. Once the database VMs are free of etcd jobs, they do not need to be deployed with write-optimized disks.

To remove etcd from your deployment, just supply the manifest generation scripts with the `-x` flag.

```bash
cd $DIEGO_RELEASE_DIR
./scripts/generate-deployment-manifest \
  -c $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/cf.yml \
  -i $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/iaas-settings.yml \
  -p $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/property-overrides.yml \
  -s $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/diego-sql.yml \
  -x \
  -n $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/instance-count-overrides.yml \
  -v $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/stubs/diego/release-versions.yml \
  > $DEPLOYMENT_DIR/deployments/diego.yml
```
